This repository provides a machine readable list of public [Galaxy instances](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/). Instances listed here must be:

- open to registration
- available on the public internet
- generally available (not offline for extended periods of time)

## About

This list was initially seeded from a couple of sources:

- [x] https://galaxyproject.org/public-galaxy-servers/
- [x] https://beta.launch.usegalaxy.org/cloudlaunch/api/v1/public_services/
- [x] https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-maps/blob/master/server.geojson

## Help us!

This list is never complete. Please feel free to [add your own server](https://github.com/martenson/public-galaxy-servers/edit/master/servers.csv) if your instance meets the requirements.
